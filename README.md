# GKMpy (work in progress)

The goal of this project is to create a python program to compute properties of GKM
manifold from its GKM graph.

At the current state, the program takes as an input an abstract graph and a
labeling of the edges (see examples). The program is able to determine a
compatible connection (if it exists) and it is able to prove orientabilty of a
closed path in the graph, see [1] for a definition.
