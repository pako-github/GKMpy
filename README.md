# GKMpy (work in progress)

The goal is to create a programm which
computes properties of GKM manifolds from its graph. At the moment the program
is able to determine if a closed path fulfills the orientability condition, see
(1).

The input is a GKM graph and a labeling of the edges (see examples). The script
is able to determine if there exists a compatible connection.
